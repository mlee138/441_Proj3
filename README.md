I named this app "Wavy Orb." This is my take on the famous/infamous Flappy Bird, but instead of a bird flapping it's wings, there is an orb that whenever you tap the screen, it will reverse it's gravity (toggling between up and down). The idea came from using the ball sprite, where I didn't think it would make sense if the ball "flapped" like a bird, so I knew I wanted it to change it's velocity whenever the user tapped on the screen. The screen only goes between two Activities where one is the title screen, and then after pressing the 'play' button, it switches to the game screen where the game takes place. I was not able to get collision to work, so there isn't actually a way to lose in the game. However, each set of rectangles you pass will grant a point and for every 10 points the speed at which the rectangles come at you increases, but the ball will also rise and drop faster as well.
